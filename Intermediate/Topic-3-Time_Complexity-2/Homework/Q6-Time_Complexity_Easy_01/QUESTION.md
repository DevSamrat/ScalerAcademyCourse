What is the Time Complexity of following snippet ?
```
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python

```
int count = 0;
while(N) {
    count++;
    N /= 3;
}
```

```
int count = 0;
while(N > 0) {
    count++;
    N /= 3;
}
```

```
count = 0
while N > 0:
    count += 1
    N = N / 3
```



####Choose the correct answer from below:
1. ```O(N)```
2. ```O(N*N)```
3. ```O(Nlog(N))```
4. ```O(log(N)) {Base 3}```
5. ```O(log(N)) {Base 2}```
