What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?
```
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python

```
for(int i = 3; i < n / 3; i += 3) {
    for(int j = 2; j < n / 2; j += 2) {
        //some O(1) operation
    }
}
```

```
for(int i = 3; i < n / 3; i += 3) {
    for(int j = 2; j < n / 2; j += 2) {
        //some O(1) operation
    }
}
```

```
for i in range(3, n / 3, 3):
    for j in range(2, n / 2, 2):
        //some O(1) operation
```



####Choose the correct answer from below:
1. ```O(N)```
2. ```O ( n ^ 3)```
3. ```O ( n ^ 2)```
4. ```O ( n ^ (1/3) )```
5. ```None of these```
