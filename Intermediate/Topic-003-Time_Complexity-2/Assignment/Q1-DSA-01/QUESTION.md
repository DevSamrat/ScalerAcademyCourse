```
An algorithm consists of two independent piece of code, having complexities f(n) and g(n) respectively. What would be the complexity of the complete algorithm
```

####Choose the correct answer from below:
1. ```f(n) x g(n)```
2. ```MAX( f(n), g(n) )```
3. ```MIN ( f(n), g(n) )```
4. ```f(n) + g(n)```
