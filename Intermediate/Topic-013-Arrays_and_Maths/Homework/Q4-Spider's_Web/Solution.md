```
Given that Spider doubles its work every day let’s figure out the amount of work done till the 14th day ( a day before 15 days ).
Let’s say the work done till the 14th day is X. Spider doubled the work done till the 14th on 15th. On day 15th, Spider did X more work.

We know that 2X = 100% work.
Which means X = 50% work.

The Spider built 50% of the web till the 14th day.
If you extend it, the Spider did 25% of the work till the 13th day.
