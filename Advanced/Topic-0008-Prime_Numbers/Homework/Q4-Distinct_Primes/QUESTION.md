###Problem Description
```
You have given an array A having N integers. Let say G is the product of all elements of A.

You have to find the number of distinct prime divisors of G.
```


<b>Input Format</b>

```
The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
```
<b>Output Format</b>

```
Return an Integer, i.e number of distinct prime divisors of G.
```
<b>Constraints</b>

```
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
```
<b>For Example</b>

```
Input:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output:
2

Explanation:
here G = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
and distinct prime divisors of G are [2, 3]
